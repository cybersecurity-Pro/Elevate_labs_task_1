# Network Reconnaissance Report

## Introduction

The purpose of this task is to perform **basic network reconnaissance** using Nmap, a popular network scanning tool.  
Network reconnaissance is a key skill in cybersecurity that allows security professionals to identify **active devices, open ports, and running services** on a network. Understanding which ports are exposed helps in evaluating potential **security risks**.

In this report, we focus on scanning a **home/local network** to identify open ports and the services running on them. The task demonstrates the use of a **TCP SYN scan (-sS)** and optional packet analysis with **Wireshark**.

## Steps Performed / Methodology

1. **Install Nmap**  
   - On **Kali Linux**, Nmap comes pre-installed.  
   - For my case, I am using **Windows**, so I downloaded it from the official website: [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html).  

2. **Check your IP address**  
   - On Windows, you can find your IP by opening **Command Prompt** and running:  
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```  
   - This provides your **IPv4 address**, which is needed to specify the target for scanning.  

3. **Run TCP SYN Scan**  
   - I used the **Nmap GUI** version on Windows. For Linux, Nmap CLI can be used.  
   - In the target field, I entered **my own IP address**, since scanning someone elseâ€™s device without permission is illegal.  
   - The TCP SYN scan (`-sS`) identifies **open ports** on the device in a stealthy manner.
```
nmap -sS 192.168.0.102
```

4. **Capture Results**  
   - Nmap displayed the **IP address and open ports**, which I noted down for analysis.  
   - A screenshot of the scan output is presented below

## Results & Analysis

The TCP SYN scan was performed on my own device (IP: `192.168.0.102`). The following open ports were detected:

| Port  | State | Service       |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 135   | open  | msrpc         |
| 139   | open  | netbios-ssn   |
| 445   | open  | microsoft-ds  |
| 5357  | open  | wsdapi        |
| 7070  | open  | realserver    |
| 8090  | open  | opsmessaging  |

**Observations:**
- Ports **135, 139, 445** are related to **Windows file sharing and remote procedure calls**, which are commonly open on Windows devices.  
- Ports **5357, 7070, 8090** are associated with **network services like WSD, RealServer, and OpsMessaging**.  
- Open ports can pose a **security risk** if services are misconfigured or vulnerable to attacks. Proper firewall configuration and service management help mitigate these risks.
