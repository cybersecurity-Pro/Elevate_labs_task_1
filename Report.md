# Network Reconnaissance Report

## Introduction

The purpose of this task is to perform **basic network reconnaissance** using Nmap, a popular network scanning tool.  
Network reconnaissance is a key skill in cybersecurity that allows security professionals to identify **active devices, open ports, and running services** on a network. Understanding which ports are exposed helps in evaluating potential **security risks**.

In this report, we focus on scanning a **home/local network** to identify open ports and the services running on them. The task demonstrates the use of a **TCP SYN scan (-sS)** and optional packet analysis with **Wireshark**.
